Save the results as:

	Pair -> PDB -> ResultDatum

Where ResultDatum contains for both from and to:

	- Atom element
	- Atom name
	- Group name
	- Chain id
	- Residue number
	- Insertion code

All optionally variable.

To deal with cases of specifying groups, as in cases of:

	Ligand's C -- 3.2-5.0 -- HIS's N
	   |--------- 2.2-3.6 -- LYS's O

Or far worse, do as follows:

	1. Find all protein matches based on distances; if a protein don't have
	a particular pair desired (i.e. no ligand's C to HIS's N at that range)
	then we exclude that protein. This will clear out most of the database.
	2. Then, assure combinations are correct. A query will specify groups,
	each with their atoms. Atoms specify the other atoms they connect to.

To find potentials in (1), do this:

	1. Go through each link individually, and find all that match it. Store
	the results of each link.
	2. The only actual candidates are those PDB IDs returned by all queries.

To find combinations in (2), do this:

	1.
